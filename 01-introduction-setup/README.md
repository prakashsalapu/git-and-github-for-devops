# 01. Introduction & Setup


## What is Git?

Git is a **Version Control System (VCS)** that helps you track changes in your project.

You can think of Git like a **time machine for your code**.  
You can move back to older versions anytime.

### Example
```
Without Git :  
- project_v1  
- project_v2  
- final_project_v3  

With Git : 
- One project folder  
- Git tracks all versions internally
```

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **cloud platform (remote)** used to store, share, and collaborate on Git repositories.

Simple difference:
- Git → works on your local system
- GitHub → stores code online

### Example

Save your repository on GitHub → Share it with others → They can contribute to your project.


## Why learn Git & GitHub?

- Track changes in code
- Work in teams
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Industry standard for developers and DevOps



## Installation & Setup

#### Windows
```
1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
2. Download the Windows installer  
3. Open the `.exe` file  
4. In **PATH environment** option, select:  
   Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software 
5. Finish installation.  
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```
brew install git
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu or Debian)
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

#### Check Git installation
```
git --version
# or
git -v
```

Example output:
```
git version 2.49.0.windows.1
```

If you see a version number, Git is installed successfully.

## Git configuration (first-time setup)

📂 Repository (Repo) – A folder where Git tracks changes

#### a) Configure Username & Email (once per machine)
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```
##### Check current config:
```
git config --global --list
```
#####  💡Example:
![Git Configuration](/01-introduction-setup/images/git-config.png)


#### b) Check whether Git is initialized or not
##### Inside your project folder:
```
ls -a         # shows hidden files like .git (Git Bash/macOS/Linux)
# or (Windows CMD)
# dir /a
```
```
💡If you see a .git/ folder → Git is initialized. If not → run git init.

```
![Git Initialize](/01-introduction-setup/images/git-init.png)

##### c) git status (and its file types)
```
Untracked → New files not tracked yet (add with git add).
Modified → Tracked files changed but not staged.
Staged → Changes added to staging area (git add), ready to commit.
Unmodified → No changes since last commit.
```
##### Check status:
```
git status
```
